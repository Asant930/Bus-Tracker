# Bus-Tracker Exercise

## Description
### This project shows how to incorporate API's into code.  This specific project shows the map to display the bus stops from the MIT campus in Boston to the Harvard campus in Cambridge.

## Future of Improvements
### I will eventually get a different type of map and show an actual line that goes from one bus stop to another.
